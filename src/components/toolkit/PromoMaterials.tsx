Not templates, not page builders — hand-coded sites that are fast, professional, and unique to your brand. Hosting is $3 a month, which is 85% less than what most companies charge.

We help small businesses get online with custom-coded websites starting at $200 — while most agencies charge $2,000 or more for the same thing. We keep costs low by cutting overhead, not quality: no office, no sales team, no middlemen. Just direct access to the developer who builds your site.\n\nOur hosting is $3 a month compared to the industry standard of $20. And every project starts with a free demo — you see your site before you spend a dollar. We also do graphic design, branding, and AI-powered business tools like automated booking and smart chatbots.\n\nIf you know any business that needs a website, we have a referral program that pays $50 per signup.`,

        content: `I started Design over Atlanta because I saw small businesses getting ripped off. Agencies charging $5,000, $10,000 for websites that could be built for a fraction of that. Website builders like Wix and Squarespace locking people into $17/month plans for cookie-cutter templates.\n\nSo I took a different approach. I build every site by hand — custom code, no templates, no page builders. Starting price is $200. That's not a landing page, that's a full professional website. And hosting? $3 a month. Most hosts charge $15 to $20.\n\nThe way I keep prices low is simple: I cut the overhead. No office lease. No sales team. No project managers marking things up. You work directly with me, the developer. That means faster turnaround, better communication, and a lot less wasted money.\n\nEvery project starts with a free demo. I build your site, show it to you, and you only pay if you love it. If you don't, you walk away — no charge, no pressure.\n\nBeyond websites, I also do graphic design — logos, business cards, social media graphics, flyers. And I build custom AI tools: automated booking systems, chatbots, smart forms. Basically anything a small business needs to look professional and run more efficiently.\n\nI've completed over 150 projects and I have a $50 referral program. If you send me a client and they sign up, you get $50 credit. No limits.\n\nHere's my card — check out the website, and feel free to reach out anytime.`,
